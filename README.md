- **City Search**: Search for the weather of any city around the globe.
- **Weather Data**: Displays temperature, weather description, and other details fetched from a weather API.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
